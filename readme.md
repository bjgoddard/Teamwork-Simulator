# Description
This is a collaborative whiteboarding tool
that encourages specification by importing your personal
team roster, categorizing them by their roles, and positioning them
where they won't screw it up for everyone. 
Register your username, create roles your team members operate as
(Linebackers, Warriors, Special Teams), and create team members with
those roles. Next create a simulation, and share the URL.
