        This is a collaborative whiteboarding tool
        that encourages specification by importing your personal
        team roster, categorizing them by their roles, and positioning them
        where they won't screw it up for everyone.

        Register your username, create roles your team members operate as
        (Linebackers, Warriors, Special Teams), and create team members with
        those roles. Next create a simulation, and share the URL.
